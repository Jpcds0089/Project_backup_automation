# Project_backup_automation
 This automation will back up the files in a specific folder. How will he do it? First the bot will open the folder that contains the files, then it will select all the files, open winrar and compress them (winrar was specifically chosen because it allows you to set a password for the file). After compression the bot will move the created file to a folder in onedriver.
